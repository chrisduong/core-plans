# Habitat Ruby Scaffolding

Ruby Scaffolding is a Habitat package which helps you build your Ruby-based **web applications**, **services**, and **processes** (hereafter referred to as "apps") into a package which runs consistently on a wide range of containers, virtual machines, or servers via the Habitat Supervisor. The Supervisor will facilitate clustering, discovery of database services, dynamically update configuration and credentials, coordinate reliable rolling updates, and a lot more!
